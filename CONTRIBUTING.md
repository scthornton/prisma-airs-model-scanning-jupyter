### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

1. **Open an issue** first to discuss major changes
2. **Check existing PRs** to avoid duplication
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch

#### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/model-scanning.git
cd model-scanning

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scthornton/model-scanning.git

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install black flake8 pytest mypy
```

#### Coding Standards

**Python Style:**
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for formatting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints where possible

**Format your code:**
```bash
# Format with Black
black .

# Check with flake8
flake8 .

# Type check with mypy
mypy .
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- Variables/functions: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
- Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

#### Notebook Contributions

When contributing Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Clear all outputs** before committing:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace notebooks/*.ipynb
   ```

2. **Never include credentials** in notebooks

3. **Add markdown explanations** for complex code cells

4. **Test the notebook** from top to bottom with "Restart & Run All"

5. **Use consistent formatting:**
   - Brief markdown headers
   - Clean code cells
   - Proper variable names

#### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add batch scanning example to notebook"
git commit -m "Fix ValidationError on HuggingFace URLs"
git commit -m "Update requirements.txt with latest SDK version"

# Bad
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "wip"
```

**Format:**
```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain the problem this commit solves and why this approach
was chosen over alternatives.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123" or "Related to #456"
```

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following coding standards

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   # Run example scripts
   python examples/list_security_groups.py
   python examples/scan_huggingface_model.py

   # Test notebook (if modified)
   jupyter notebook
   # Run all cells and verify outputs
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**

5. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what changed and why
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Reference to related issues

7. **Respond to feedback** - Be open to suggestions

## Style Guide

### Python

```python
# Good
def scan_model(model_uri: str, security_group_uuid: UUID) -> ScanResult:
    """
    Scan a model for security vulnerabilities.

    Args:
        model_uri: HuggingFace model URL
        security_group_uuid: Security group to use

    Returns:
        Scan result object

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If model URI format is invalid
    """
    client = ModelSecurityAPIClient()
    return client.scan(
        security_group_uuid=security_group_uuid,
        model_uri=model_uri
    )

# Bad
def scan(m,s):  # Unclear variable names, no type hints, no docstring
    c = ModelSecurityAPIClient()
    return c.scan(s,m)
```

### Markdown

```markdown
# Use clear headers

## Subsections are H2

### Sub-subsections are H3

- Use bullet lists for unordered items
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Be consistent with punctuation

1. Use numbered lists for sequential steps
2. Each step should be actionable
3. Test instructions before committing

**Bold** for emphasis, *italics* for technical terms.

`Code` in backticks for inline code.

\```python
# Code blocks with language specified
print("Hello World")
\```
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Test your changes:

1. **Create fresh virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv test-venv
   source test-venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run example scripts:**
   ```bash
   python examples/list_security_groups.py
   python examples/scan_huggingface_model.py
   ```

3. **Test notebooks:**
   - Open in Jupyter
   - Kernel → Restart & Run All
   - Verify no errors

### Automated Testing

(Future: Add pytest tests)

```bash
pytest tests/
```
